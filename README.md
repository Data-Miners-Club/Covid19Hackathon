## Problem Statement <br />
Over the course of the last few months, COVID-19 has drastically changed and affected people's daily lives and businesses.One sector that is especially facing the repercussions of the virus is the University system in the US. Colleges started to take measures to combat the implications of the virus in early March - There are many factors that drove the decision making process at each of the colleges.<br />

Are private colleges more likely to have in-person classes? <br />
Has the pandemic disproportionately affected lower ranked colleges? <br />
What has been the response of colleges which heavily depend on tuition from out of state and international students?<br />
<br />
Weâ€™re interested in understanding the motivations and timelines behind how colleges in the US have responded to the situation.<br />
